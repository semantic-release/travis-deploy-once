# travis-deploy-once

Run a deployment script only once in the [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) test matrix.

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/semantic-release/travis-deploy-once.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

On Travis builds running multiple jobs (to test with multiple [Node versions](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/#Specifying-Node.js-versions) and/or [OSs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/)), run some code from the `after_success` phase only once, after all other jobs have completed successfully.

Your code will run only on the job with the highest node version (i.e. the build leader).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save travis-deploy-once
```

## Usage

```js
const deployOnce = require('travis-deploy-once');

try {
  const result = await deployOnce({travisOpts: {pro: true}, GH_TOKEN: 'xxxxxx', BUILD_LEADER_ID: 1});
} catch (err) {
  // something went wrong, and err will tell you what
}

if (result === true) deployMyThing();
if (result === false) console.log('Some job(s) failed');
if (result === null) console.log('Did not run as the build leader');
```

## API

### deployOnce([options])

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to:
- `true` if the current Travis job is the build leader, the current `script` phase is successful and all other job have completed successfully. => Your code can safely run.
- `false` if at least one Travis job failed. => Your code should not run.
- `null` if the current Travis job is **not** the build leader. => Your code should not run, and will be executed on the build leader.

Throws an `Error` if:
- It doesn't run on Travis.
- The Github authentication token is missing.
- The Github authentication token is not authorized with Travis.
- It doesn't run on after_success step.
